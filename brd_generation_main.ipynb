The system will address current inefficiencies by automating stock updates, providing real-time alerts, and generating comprehensive reports. This will result in reduced manual errors, improved stock management, and enhanced decision-making capabilities for management.  The following sections detail the functional and non-functional requirements necessary to achieve these goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "=== Business Goals ===\n",
            "Here are 3 specific business goals for the Inventory Management System (IMS) project based on the provided context:\n",
            "\n",
            "Reduce Inventory Management Costs: By automating stock tracking and reducing manual errors, the IMS will minimize labor costs associated with manual stocktaking, data entry, and error correction.\n",
            "\n",
            "Improve Inventory Accuracy: Real-time stock level updates and automated alerts will significantly improve the accuracy of inventory data, leading to less stockouts and overstocking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Enhance Decision-Making with Data-Driven Insights:  The improved reporting capabilities (daily reports, detailed sales and inventory reports) will provide managers with timely and accurate data to make informed decisions regarding purchasing, pricing, and sales strategies.\n",
            "\n",
            "=== Functional Requirements ===\n",
            "1. The IMS shall track inventory levels for each product at each store location, displaying current quantity on hand, and allowing for real-time updates.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The IMS shall allow authorized users to create, edit, and delete stock entries, including details such as product ID, quantity, date received, and supplier information.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The IMS shall generate daily reports summarizing inventory levels, sales data, and low-stock alerts, automatically emailing these reports to designated managers.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. The IMS shall send email alerts to designated personnel when the stock level of any product at any location falls below a pre-defined, user-configurable threshold.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. The IMS shall allow for the generation of detailed sales and inventory reports, customizable by date range, product, and location.\n",
            "\n",
            "=== Non-Functional Requirements ===\n",
            "* Performance: The system shall maintain a response time of under 2 seconds for all critical operations (stock queries, report generation, alert notifications) during peak usage hours (defined as 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday).  This ensures a smooth and efficient user experience even during periods of high demand.\n",
            "\n",
            "* Usability: The system's interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for all users, regardless of their technical expertise.  This will be measured through user acceptance testing (UAT) with a target satisfaction score of at least 4 out of 5.  Training materials shall be provided and readily accessible.\n",
            "\n",
            "* Reliability: The system shall have a 99.9% uptime guarantee.  Data backups shall occur every 24 hours with a full system recovery time of under 1 hour in case of failure.  Regular system maintenance and security patching shall be conducted to minimize downtime and vulnerabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "* Security: The system shall protect sensitive inventory and sales data using industry-standard encryption methods (e.g., TLS 1.3) and access control mechanisms (e.g., role-based access control).  Regular security audits shall be performed to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n",
